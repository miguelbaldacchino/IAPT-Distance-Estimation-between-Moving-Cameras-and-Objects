# Distance-Estimation-between-Moving-Cameras-and-Objects
Individual Assigned Practical Task (IAPT)

This repository hosts the full practical implementation of a computer vision system capable of estimating real-time distances between moving cameras and dynamic objects in the scene. This project is developed as part of the Individual Assigned Practical Task (APT) under the Artificial Intelligence department at the University of Malta, aimed at solving real-world challenges through autonomous design, research, and implementation.

This project simulates scenarios commonly found in automotive safety systems (e.g., dashcams, drones, mobile AR) where estimating object proximity accurately is critical. A complete cycle of development — from dataset collection and literature review to implementation, evaluation, and reporting — was undertaken individually.
